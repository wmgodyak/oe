##PHPUnit repository

For installing the PHPUnit test by composer use the following:

    "require-dev": {
        "smarty/smarty-phpunit": "3.1.21"
    }

Replace 3.1.21 with the installed Smarty version number.

Starting with Smarty version 3.1.22 the "require-dev" section will be added
to the composer.json file of the Smarty distribution.

The tests for the custom template and cache resources Mysql, Memcache and APC can
be enabled in config.xml.
